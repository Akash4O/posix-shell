## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

- **Moving Files**: If you try to pass more than two arguments to the `mv` command, the shell will display an error:
  - Example: `mv: can't pass more than 2 parameters`
- **Directory Issues**: If a directory does not exist when using commands like `mv`, you'll get an error message:
  - Example: `There is no such directory: [path]`

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repo to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/posix-shell.git
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**: Next, compile the Java files using the `javac` command.

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

3. **Run the Shell**: Finally, execute the compiled code with the `java` command.

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
