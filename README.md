# POSIX-Shell Implementation

## Overview

This project is a Java-based POSIX-like shell implementation, offering support for several basic shell commands. It provides users with an interactive terminal to execute commands for file and directory management, navigation, and text output. The shell also supports handling external commands available in the system's `PATH`.

---

## Features

### Built-In Commands
The shell includes the following built-in commands:

| Command       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `echo`        | Prints a string or message to the console.                                 |
| `exit 0`      | Exits the shell.                                                           |
| `type <cmd>`  | Identifies whether the command is built-in or external.                    |
| `pwd`         | Displays the current working directory.                                    |
| `cd <dir>`    | Changes the current working directory. Supports relative and absolute paths.|
| `ls`          | Lists files and directories in the current working directory.              |
| `cat <file>`  | Displays the contents of a file.                                           |
| `touch <file>`| Creates an empty file in the current directory.                            |
| `rm <file>`   | Deletes a file from the current directory.                                 |
| `mkdir <dir>` | Creates a new directory in the current working directory.                  |

### External Commands
The shell can execute external system commands if they are available in the system's `PATH`. For example, commands like `java`, `gcc`, or `python` can be executed if installed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before running the shell, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher).
- A terminal or command prompt to run the compiled program.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository or download the `Main.java` file directly to your system.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
   (Replace `<repository_url>` with the link to this repository.)

2. **Compile the Program**  
   Use the `javac` command to compile the `Main.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**  
   After compilation, start the shell by executing:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Launch the program in your terminal:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
2. The shell will display a prompt:
   ```
   Welcome to POSIX-Shell. Type 'exit 0' to quit.
   $
   ```
3. Type any supported command and press Enter. For example:
   - Print a message:
     ```bash
     $ echo "Hello, World!"
     ```
   - List files in the current directory:
     ```bash
     $ ls
     ```
   - Navigate to a directory:
     ```bash
     $ cd my_directory
     ```
   - Display the current working directory:
     ```bash
     $ pwd
     ```

4. To exit the shell, type:
   ```bash
   exit 0
   ```

## Examples

Here are some example commands and their outputs:

### Echo Command
```bash
$ echo "This is a POSIX shell"
This is a POSIX shell
```

### PWD Command
```bash
$ pwd
/home/user/posix-shell
```

### LS Command
```bash
$ ls
file1.txt
dir1/
file2.java
```

### CD Command
```bash
$ cd dir1
$ pwd
/home/user/posix-shell/dir1
```

### CAT Command
```bash
$ cat file1.txt
Hello, this is a text file.
```

### Touch Command
```bash
$ touch newfile.txt
File Created Successfully.
```

### RM Command
```bash
$ rm newfile.txt
```

### MKDIR Command
```bash
$ mkdir newdir
Directory created Successfully!
```

### External Commands
```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "17.0.1" 2021-10-19
```

---

## Error Handling
- If a command is not recognized, the shell displays:
  ```
  <command>: command not found
  ```
- If a file or directory does not exist, appropriate error messages will be shown, such as:
  ```
  cat: myfile.txt: No such file
  cd: /nonexistent: No such file or directory
  ```

---

## Code Structure

- **Main.java**: The primary file containing the logic for the shell. It includes:
  - Input handling for commands.
  - Execution of built-in commands.
  - Handling of external commands using `Runtime.getRuntime()`.

### Key Methods
- `handleEcho(String input)`: Prints the provided message to the terminal.
- `handlePwd()`: Prints the current working directory.
- `handleCd(String input)`: Changes the current working directory.
- `handleLs()`: Lists all files and directories in the current directory.
- `handleCat(String input)`: Reads and displays the contents of a file.
- `handleTouch(String input)`: Creates an empty file.
- `handleRm(String input)`: Deletes a file.
- `handleMkdir(String input)`: Creates a directory.
- `handleExternalCommand(String input)`: Executes commands available in the system's `PATH`.

---

## Limitations
- The shell does not support piping (`|`) or redirection (`>`/`<`).
- Limited error messages for external command execution failures.
- Does not support advanced shell scripting features.
